I worked on my springing of my DIY spacemouse. Current design uses 1 compression spring in the center and 3 extension springs on the sides.

Modeled a PCB for the sensors and the analog-digital converter

Settled down on the springing mechanism for the first prototype. It uses 3 extension springs, planar oriented, with 120° to each other (springs not modeled).

Started modeling the assembly: spring mechanism, alignment ring for the sensors
