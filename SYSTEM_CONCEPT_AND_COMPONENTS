Goals:
- 6 DGF
- 4 Macrobuttons 
- Different Profiles (indicated by LED)
- OLED Display
- Compatible with Fusion360
- USB C
- Premium feeling (surface finishing & weight)
- Cheap (using parts I already have or parts that are easy/cheap available)

Concept:
- Spring loaded knob
- Motion decoding using 4 magnets and 8 hall sensores (in groups of 2). The hall sensores are mountet with an offset to the magnets to detect relative shift in 2 directions
- Different Profiles for different uses: 1 Sketch made (yellow) / 2 Move mode (blue) / 3 edit mode (green) / 4 default mode (orange)
- Display the button functions and the profile on the screen

Hardware:
- Arduino pro Micro
- SS495A Hall Sensor (8x)
- WS2812B LED ring (50mm OD, 12 LED)
. 6*2.5 round Magnet (4x)
- 0.96' OLED Display
- M3 Screws
- M3 heated inserts
- PLA/Abs
- 5mm round rubber feet (4x)
- 5g steel weights
- Analog Digital Converter MCP3008-I/P
